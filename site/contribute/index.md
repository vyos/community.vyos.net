# Contributing to VyOS

VyOS development process is open and transparent. We welcome everyone to contribute!
There's a lot of work to do: writing code, writing and editing documentation,
testing latest builds and more.

## Why contribute?

### Copyright stays with you

Unlike some other projects, we intentionally do not use a contributor agreement
that would give us exclusive rights to your contributions.

The copyrights to VyOS source code and documentation remain shared between all
contributors, so that no one (including its current maintainers) can make a
proprietary fork.

### We have rewards

Maintaining an LTS version is a hard, delicate, high-responsibility work. Being
a maintainer means not being able to refuse to work on the hard tasks. We keep
prebuilt LTS images behind a paywall for that reason, but we are ready to share
our work with everyone who helps us move the project forward.

This includes everyone who contributes code, tests latest builds, writes
documentation, or promotes VyOS in the social media or at live events.
