  ## Our eligibility guidelines are as follows

  - **Programmers**

    Three merged, non-trivial<fn id="non-trivial">Non-trivial is relative of course. A single typo fix is trivial, while extensive proofreading of help strings and error messages definitely counts. Contact us if not sure.</fn> pull requests to the source code within the last year.

  - **Documentation writers**

    Six merged, non-trivial pull requests to the documentation within the last year.

  - **Testers**

    Six non-trivial bug reports within the last year.

  - **Evangelists**

    A provable<fn id="evangelists">Many people tell us that they promote VyOS among friends and collegues. It may be true, but the problem is that anyone can say that. If you want to get a subscription as an evangelist, please supply links to posts or recorded talks.</fn> track record of posting about VyOS (whether on your own site or on social media) or speaking about it at live events (offline or online).
