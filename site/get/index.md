  ## Rolling release

  Rolling release builds include all latest developments from maintainers and community contributors.
  There are no stability guarantees â€” anything may change, experimental features can be added,
  and old features can be removed at any time. They are meant for development and testing.

  Rolling release builds are for you if you...

  - want to help us test latest VyOS code
  - want to check whether a bug is fixed in the latest code
  - made a patch and want to test it before making a pull request

  Go to the [rolling release page](/get/nightly-builds) to download.

  ## VyOS Stream

  VyOS Stream serves as a technology preview and a quality gate for the upcoming LTS release.
  New images are releases roughly every quarter.

  Features can only be removed from VyOS Stream through a deprecation procedure,
  and we promise to only make forward-compatible changes to the configuration syntax
  and API, so that users, integrators, and developers of external tools
  can prepare their environments and projects for the future LTS release
  and help us identify and fix issues.

  Go to the [VyOS Stream page](/get/stream) to download.

  ## LTS release

  Prebuilt LTS release images are available to people and companies who help us move the project
  forward.
