  VyOS rolling release builds are automatically produced from the `current` branch at least once a day.

  They include all the latest code from maintainers and community contributors.

  Rolling release builds are not hand-tested before upload.
  They undergo a sequence of automated [smoke tests](https://github.com/vyos/vyos-1x/tree/current/smoketest/scripts/cli).
  In addition we load arbitrary [configurations](https://github.com/vyos/vyos-1x/tree/current/smoketest/configs) to ensure
  there are no errors during config migration and system bootup.

  ## Verifying image signatures

  We use [minisign](https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/) for release signing. To learn about its advantages
  over GPG, read [signify: Securing OpenBSD From Us To You](https://www.openbsd.org/papers/bsdcan-signify.html).

  One obvious advantage is that you don't need to import the key anywhere, you can pass it as a command line argument.
  Once you download an image and its `.minisig` file, you can verify its integrity with this command:

  ```
  minisign -Vm <ISO file> -P RWSIhkR/dkM2DSaBRniv/bbbAf8hmDqdbOEmgXkf1RxRoxzodgKcDyGq
  ```

  If in doubt, you can get the public key from the [nightly builds repository](https://github.com/vyos/vyos-nightly-build/blob/main/minisign.pub).
  If you are _really_ in doubt (i.e., you have a reason to suspect that the repository and/or this website were compromised),
  you should report that to the maintainers.

  Currently, we create rolling release builds with GitHub Actions and store them in releases of the [vyos/vyos-nightly-build](https://github.com/vyos/vyos-nightly-build/releases)
  repository. Here is an auto-generated list of available builds.
