    <p>VyOS is a fully open-source, enterprise-grade router platform. Being open-source and community-driven is not a liability for us, not an early stage gimmick we want to shed—it’s our distinctive advantage. VyOS started as a community fork of a discontinued Vyatta Core project in 2013, with a promise to live up to free and open-source software values. We kept the promise and turned VyOS into a successful, self-funded project. </p>

          <p>VyOS is fully open-source and we encourage everyone to build images and report any build process issues. However, simply making code available is not enough.</p>
          <p>We also keep the complete build toolchain available, and we strive to make it easy to use. You can build a VyOS image in just a few commands. There is no special maintainer toolchain we keep to ourselves: all image build tools are available to everyone interested.</p>

          <p>VyOS is not just a product, but an open platform. It uses a layered architecture with unified and documented internal APIs.</p>
          <p>Many major features were contributed by community members. Command definitions are written in a machine-verifiable XML format and malformed definitions fail the build. Our new code is in legacy-free Python3, and some core components are in OCaml.</p>
          <p>Every part of the system is open to contributions.</p>
