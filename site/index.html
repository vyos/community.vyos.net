        <p>VyOS is a fully open source, enterprise-grade router platform. Being open source and community-driven is not a liability for us, not an early stage gimmick we want to shed—it’s our distinctive advantage. VyOS started as a community fork of a discontinued Vyatta Core project in 2013, with a promise to live up to free and open source software values. We kept the promise and turned VyOS into a successful, self-funded project. </p>

              <p>VyOS is fully open source and we encourage everyone to build images and report any build process issues. The source code of the rolling release and LTS branches alike is available online. However, simply making code available is not enough.</p>
              <p>We also keep the complete build toolchain available, and we strive to make it easy to use. You can build a VyOS image in just a few commands. There is no special maintainer toolchain we keep to ourselves: all image build tools are available to everyone interested.</p>

              <p>VyOS is not just a product, but an open platform. It uses a layered architecture with unified and documented internal APIs.</p>
              <p>A number of major features were contributed by community members. Command definitions are written in a machine-verifiable XML format and malformed definitions fail the build. Our new code is in legacy-free Python3, and some core components are in OCaml.</p>
              <p>Every part of the system is open to contributions.</p>
